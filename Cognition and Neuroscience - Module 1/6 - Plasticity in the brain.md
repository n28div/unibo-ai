# Plasticity in the brain
*lesson 2021-04-19*

The idea is that our **neurons** don't just communicate, rather send/receive informations in a way that aids the system to sustain itself.

Repetetive neuronal activation leads to a long-term change in the neurons response, this process is known as **hebbian plasticity**
Most used connections are strengthen: connections undergo structural changes which make the network stronger, i.e. more capable of doing something.

For example, when learning a new musical instrument, the more practice we get, the better we are. The same goes for learning a new language.
In children hebbian plasticity is higher.

Hebbian plasticity is crucial from the AI point of view: having to produce a system that is capable of having this *plasticity* requires understanding how the system works.

Different brain areas provide a function in the human perception. Visual area V5, for example, takes care of movement recognition.
Retina's information are passed to V1 as we have already seen. At some point neuronal connections will bring these informations to V5 which will activate if a movement has been recognized.
Information provided by V5 needs to be sent back to V1, otherwise movement could end up unperceived.

## Key concepts
- How are visual motion areas connected (we know that movement triggers different motion areas, the more complex the movement, the more areas)
- How changing the weight of a connection modulates the perception of motion

Finally, the greatest question: we know that if we keep on doing something, we get better. Then, **why does this happen and how?**, how do we test the hebbian plasticity?
What we're interested in is understanding how, if we continuously do something, a non-changing experiment is performed better by a subject by stimulating certain areas.

We're trying to understand how the feedback connectivity affects sensitivity to motion. To this extent Romei et al. carried an experiment using ccPAS, a neuro-stimulation paradigm using TMS with two coils that are targeting the two areas we're interested in. These areas are repeatedly stimulated to try and moderate the performance of the subjects in the global motion perception task. Note that TMS coils are covering huge areas of the brain, but it's quite likely that by stimulating an area we're covering the right neurons, which are functionally connected. If V1 is the area we're interested in, and V5 is the area for motion perception, we'll want to strengthen the connection between these two by stimulating the areas.

Researches have shown that the connection between V5 and V1 has a 20ms lag in real situations, so we can perform stimulations intervalled by 20ms to try and reinforce the connection V5-->V1.

 Experiment is carried by applying TMS to V1 area and, after 20ms, to V5 area. This should strenghten connections between V1 and V5.
 In order to shown the causal relation between TMS application, TMS has also been applied simultaneously to both areas and not applied at all. Both the last conditions should give no enhancement in the subject performance.
 Subject's are shown dots moving coherently in a certain direction where a certain percentage of the total dots is just noise.
 By presenting the experiment to subjects we can find the partecipant threshold, % of points moving coherently.
 Applying ccPAS enhances candidates performance from 30 to 60 minutes after the experiment has ccPAS has been applied.
 
 Functional connections are plastic and follow Hebbian rules and feedback connectivity plays a major role in efficient processing information.
