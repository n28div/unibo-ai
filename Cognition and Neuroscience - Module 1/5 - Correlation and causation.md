# Correlation is not causation

Technical advances in the neuroscience subject allow to make use of **Online TMS and EEG**. This type of setting allows to stimulate brain through TMS and see how the result affects the brain.
It's a novel technique and still as some problems, mainly to the interference that TMS produce with EEG.

Combining TMS and EEG allow:
- **inductive approach** where the TMS is used to evoke action potentials (TEPs) in order to asses the cortical reactivity and connectivity. An experiment where these kind of setting was used showed that, when applying TMS to an wake person the response of the brain is different than if the person is sleeping. While sleeping the subject's brain is less responsive.
- **interactive approach** used to test how TMS affects functional brain areas during a cognitive task.

It has been shown by Rosanova et al. that applying TMS on different brain areas results in the stimulation of different brain waves, i.e. applying it in the visual cortex generates activity in the alpha band.

Combination between TMS and EEG allow to shift from a correlational approach (measure EEG activity before perceiving a stimulus to correlate it to perception) to a causal approach (manipulating the brain activity through TMS to show changes in perception).

One of the main research in this area is about entrainment: using rTMS burst to modulate a particular oscillation band in order to modify perception.
Thut et al. proved that, using rTMS it is indeed possible. 

In an experiment carried by Trajkovic et al. stimulating with TMS to modulate the alpha band changed stimulus perception. In fact, when increasing alpha band frequency precision in perceiving a stimulus where higher if compared to the ones with no stimulation.

Another important application of alpha band is in multiple stimulus perception.
It has been shown that on average, though it changes across individuals, two stimulus are perceived as one if they occur in the same 100ms time window.
Coincidentally an alpha cycle lasts on average 100ms (10Hz) and it varies across individuals (8-14Hz).
It could be the case that stimulus integration happens during an alpha cycle.

This give rise to a **illusion** where, if two stimulus are presented in the same time window they are perceived as one (see https://shamslab.psych.ucla.edu/demos/).

By using a correlation approach Romei et al. showed using EEG that temporal illusion window correlates with alpha waves frequency.
Moreover, by using tES and both sound and visual stimulus (tES was used to not make noise, as TMS does) they showed that modulating the alpha wave band causes the temporal window of perception to change.
Higher frequency have a shorter time window.
This has also been proven with the use of MEG.
