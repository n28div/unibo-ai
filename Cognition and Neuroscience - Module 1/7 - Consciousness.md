# Consciousness
*lesson from 2021-04-19* 

How can we define **consciousness**? Something like *the subjective experience of being conscious*.

Why should we need this? An AI isn't conscious and works better than us! One thing  to denote is that if you try to get what we need it for, we may think about an evolutionary thing that changes behaviour. If the environment wants us to adapt, and the information aid us in building a model, why does the conscience take form?

How does consciousness arise?
In 1988 Baars proposed the **global workspace theory (GWT)** in which conscoiusness is a supremely functional biological adapatation. Consciousness basically integrate perception, thought and action.
If you make a speech error you don't fix it until you become aware of it, previously you do it unconsiously.
Any piece of information is conscious if it is broadcasted to many areas of the unconscious brain.

The *theatre hypothesis* states that conscious events happen in the *theatre of consciousness*. We have many things that we do unconciously and few that we are really aware of.

Consciousness acts as a bright spot on the stage, and it is surrounded by a fringe of events that are only vaguely conscious. The rest of our brain is doing things in background/receiving informations from the bright spot. Now, why this theory? What sense does it make? Why is it heavily grounded in psychology? We talk about the backstage as the neural processes, the bright spot as our **attention**, and the rest of the stage as the **working memory**.
Interaction between these elements constitute the GWT.

The human brain is structured so that it can have at most 7+-2 items within the global workspace at the same time.
The thatre has many inputs from the senses, the overall context and the connection to unconscious resources (for ex. language).
Consciousness works as a gateway, providing access to lexicon, authobiographical memories, enable voluntary actions over routine etc.
**Consciousness is a working part of the cognitive system**.

In 2006 **Neuronal GWT** have been proposed: specialized unsconscious processors compete for access to the limited capacity of Global Workspace.
Scientific community is divided on *where* consciousness is located but its slowly converging in frontal areas: the areas that in humans have developed more wrt other animals.
Different information comes to the brain at the same time and are broadcasted to different brain areas. The possibility of being able to verbally report it is experienced as a conscious state.

Measuring EEG the difference between conscious and unsonscious stimulus perception lies in the frontal areas activation: it seems like only conscious stimuli reach the frontal area, where consciousness is proposed to be localized.

If there could be the possibility of figuring out all the connections inside a brain and reproduce them in an artificial neural network, would this system be conscious? We don't really know...
